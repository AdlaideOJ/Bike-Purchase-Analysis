**Bike Purchase Analysis by Gender and Demographics â€“ Excel Project**

This is my first data analytics project created to practice analyzing data using Microsoft Excel. The project explores how gender, marital status, education level, and age influence bike purchase decisions.

It helped me build confidence in organizing data, creating meaningful visuals, and drawing simple, actionable insights using Excel.

**Tools Used**

1. Microsoft Excel for sorting, filtering, data analysis, and building visual dashboards

**Key Visuals and Insights**
1. A line chart to observe trends across different age groups
2. A bar chart comparing bike purchases between males and females across demographic segments
3. An interactive Excel dashboard summarizing patterns based on gender, marital status, and education level etc

**Insight:**
Middle aged people were the most likely to purchase bikes.

**Note:**
This project uses sample data and was completed using only Excel as part of my beginner level learning experience. It reflects the early stage of my journey into data analytics, and I look forward to building on it with more advanced tools and techniques in future projects.
